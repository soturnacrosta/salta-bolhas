Synopsis
Gipito is a tadpole who fell asleep in the water and became easy prey for a hungry heron. While swimming to survive, he tumbled down a waterfall into the lake below. To help the tadpole, you'll need to jump on the bubbles in the waterfall's foam and reach the deep waters safely.

Objective
The goal of the game is to stay on the bubbles for as long as possible, jumping from one to another, without falling into the void.
