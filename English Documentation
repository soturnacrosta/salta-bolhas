Project
The 2D platformer game Salta Bolhas, developed using the Unity engine, is being created during the global event Global Game Jam at the Unipê campus in João Pessoa, Paraíba. The event brings together developers, designers, and analysts-in-training to create a simple game within 48 hours.

With the theme BUBBLES, the game features gameplay where the main character must survive as long as possible by jumping from bubble to bubble without falling into the void. The bubbles vary in size, and their popping time changes upon being touched.

Synopsis
Gipito is a tadpole who fell asleep in the water and became an easy target for a hungry heron. While swimming for survival, he was swept down a waterfall into a lake. To help the tadpole, you must jump on the bubbles in the waterfall’s foam and safely reach the deep waters.

Requirements
The game’s theme, BUBBLES, guides the entire project. Accordingly, the design and storytelling revolve around the main character and the bubbles in the environment. The fundamental requirements are:

A timer to track the score—the longer you survive, the higher your score.
Bubbles spawn randomly and pop when touched.
Bubbles come in different sizes, with their popping time varying by size.
The map’s “floor” is the void—touching it results in Game Over.
The menu must be lightweight and feature harmonious colors.
The environment must be lightweight and feature harmonious colors.
The game must include a soundtrack.
Development
Salta Bolhas is being developed by the team Matheus Argolo (developer and designer), Isabella Avellar (designer), and Mailton Lemos (developer) in a Windows 10 environment using the Unity engine, Visual Studio Code IDE, and C# language. Version control is managed on GitHub. Documentation is compact due to time constraints.

Review
The game was delivered in a functional state. Its mechanics work as expected, and the game has a beginning, middle, and end. The soundtracks and sound effects provide immersion, while the visuals are clean, with a harmonious and lightweight design as requested. The documentation and manual in both Portuguese and English bring the company and players closer to the project.

Retrospective
The team for this project was formed on the spot, and working on it brought us closer together. Each member contributed their skills and expertise when needed, leaving their mark on the project. A Game Jam is time-limited, but it still allows for impressive results.

All requirements were delivered, except for one item in Day 4’s backlog: the Game Over screen soundtrack wasn’t added due to time constraints. Even so, the result was completely satisfying for everyone, and we left the experience feeling accomplished.
